# Smart Mask

# **Project Title: Smart Mask**
This project "SMART MASK" falls under the category of Internet of Things (IOT).
Masks are a simple barrier to help prevent your respiratory droplets from reaching others.
Studies show that masks reduce the spray of droplets when worn over the nose and mouth.
Masks should be used as part of a comprehensive ‘Do it all!’ approach including physical distancing, avoiding crowded, closed and close-contact settings, good ventilation, cleaning hands, covering sneezes and coughs, and more.
Depending on the type, masks can be used for either protection of healthy persons or to prevent onward transmission.

# **OBJECTIVE OF PROJECT:**
  Since mask not only protects us but others also. As the world is becoming digital, I have thought to make a smart mask with the following features:
1. Reminder Box
2. Temperature Sensor
3. Distance Sensor
4. Air Pollution Monitoring

# SCOPE OF PROJECT:
**The scope of the project is as follows:**
## **1. Reminder Box:**
This box will contain the mask that I am implementing, it will be kept near the house entrance as soon as it detects the person the LED will glow, reminding you have to carry your mask with you. Because it is not only necessary to buy a mask but wear it whenever and wherever we go.
## **2. Temperature Sensor:**
This will help to measure the temperature and get notification on your cell phone as and when needed.
## **3. Distance Sensor:**
There will be a buzzer implemented with this, which will buzz reminding we have to maintain social distance. According to the survey, 73% people feel this is useful.
## **4. Air Pollution Monitoring:**
This will help us to know in which surrounding we are and how much it can affect us, apart from protecting.
